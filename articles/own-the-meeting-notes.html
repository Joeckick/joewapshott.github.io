            <p>No one wants to be the note-taker. It feels like extra work, like something junior. You're in the meeting to contribute, not to scribe.</p>

            <p>But writing and distributing meeting notes is one of the highest-leverage activities a product manager can take on. Well-written notes create alignment, drive accountability, and keep things moving. The person who writes the notes controls the narrative of what was decided and what happens next.</p>

            <p>AI note-taking apps have made transcription effortless. You can record a meeting and get a summary in minutes. But a transcript isn't the same as notes. A transcript is what was said. Notes are what mattered. That distinction is where the value lies.</p>

            <p>When you own the notes, you decide what the key takeaways are. You frame the decisions. You assign the actions. That's not administrative work. That's influence.</p>

            <p>Here's how to make your notes actually useful.</p>

            <p>Start with key takeaways and decisions. Time-poor executives will skim. Make it easy for them to get what they need at a glance. If someone only reads the first three lines, those lines should contain the most important information.</p>

            <p>Actions need owners. List what was agreed, who's responsible, and when it's due. Shared accountability only works if it's written down. Verbal commitments disappear. Written ones don't.</p>

            <p>Write for the audience. Notes for an exec should be concise. Notes for your team can include more context and narrative to bring them on the journey. One size doesn't fit all.</p>

            <p>Follow a consistent format. Familiarity makes information easier to process. If your notes always follow the same structure, people know where to look without having to think about it.</p>

            <p>Send them fast. Ideally the same day, while the meeting is still fresh. Momentum matters. The longer you wait, the more likely the decisions drift or get relitigated.</p>

            <p>Let the AI handle the transcription. But own the synthesis. That's where the leverage is.</p>
